						<p>Shaker blog PRIVACY POLICY
								When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.
								
								This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.</p>
						<blockquote class="blockquote">
							<p>You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Shaker blog Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Shaker blog services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Shaker blog or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.

									To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.</p>
